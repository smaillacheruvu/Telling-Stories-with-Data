# Intelligent Transportation Systems Chart Redesign



You can access the original report from which I pulled the ITS work safety zone for freeway chart here: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/60122. The chart of interest is on page 21 (PDF page 31) of the report. I have also included a screenshot of the original chart for quick reference below. You can reference the source data via the links below.
