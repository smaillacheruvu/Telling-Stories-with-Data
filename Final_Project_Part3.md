## Part 3: Final Project 

### Refining scope & audience
After reviewing my interviews and reflecting on the project, I identified the audience as a group of nontechnical people who want a quick, digestible snapshot of energy insecurity. Specific audience members include congressional aides, who oversee a variety of policy issues and have limited bandwidth; policymakers at various levels (federal, state, and local), who want to know the essence of the issue and who it impacts; and advocates or curious members of the public, who want to better understand the issue and see what programs they can champion. As a baseline, I assume that the audience has no background in the issue, so I’ve tried to use simple language, free of jargon, to effectively communicate. I also realize that people might want to dive deeper into the issue, so I’ve shared links throughout from my sources, for individuals who want to further educate themselves.
