## Process
Reflecting on Part 1 and Part 2 of the project, <b>I see that some elements from the initial outline of the project have remained consistent</b>, such as first establishing the emotional stakes of the issue. As a hook into the story, framing energy insecurity in a personal, felt way was something that my interviewees noted that they liked. I’ve also largely adhered to the general flow of my outline from Part 1 and story board form Part 2: emotional hook, demographics, coping strategies, and climate change. From my Part 2, I made a list of “to-do” items to implement in the final version per slide and/or section. This list was incredibly helpful in working my way through my visualizations, allowing me to modify them per my interviewees’ and in-class peer group’s feedback and move to the next.

<b>But certain elements of the story have transformed significantly.</b> For example, to visualize the different coping mechanisms households use in the face of energy insecurity, I first thought I’d use a bubble chart. In his feedback, Prof. Goranson mentioned that bubble charts are often not easily interpretable to viewers, so I switched the visualization to a tree map. But my peers in my in-class review group noted confusion over this reworked visualization: they needed more context, or at least, the number of households engaging in each coping mechanism, to make this graph work. Ultimately, I decided to make this visualization into a pictogram with only one coping mechanisms, pulling in the other coping strategies in the write-up. While I ultimately went for a simpler visualization with less data, the final version is more communicable, conveying the idea in one quick glance as opposed to ten seconds of hovering over different aspects of the chart. 

## Refining scope & audience
After reviewing my interviews and reflecting on the project, I identified the audience as a group of nontechnical people who want a quick, digestible snapshot of energy insecurity. Specific audience members include congressional aides, who oversee a variety of policy issues and have limited bandwidth; policymakers at various levels (federal, state, and local), who want to know the essence of the issue and who it impacts; and advocates or curious members of the public, who want to better understand the issue and see what programs they can champion. As a baseline, I assume that the audience has very little to no background on the issue, so I’ve tried to use simple language, free of jargon, to effectively communicate. I also realize that people might want to dive deeper into the issue, so I’ve shared links throughout from my sources, for individuals who want to further educate themselves. 

## High-level takeaways
•	<b>Simplicity is key:</b> I often found myself trading nice but less immediately legible charts for simpler ones, to make the story as simple to understand as possible, i.e., to reduce barriers to entry. E.g., I swapped the tree map for a pictogram.
<br>
•	<b>Elevate lived experience:</b> From my original proposal onward, I have wanted to integrate the experiences of people who deal with energy insecurity on a daily basis. Throughout the story, I have added block quotes as stand-alone black-and white slides with yellow-text highlight to visually force viewers to contend with how energy insecurity actually impacts people.<br>
•	<b>Use color cohesively:</b> Many of my interviewees noted that the color scheme was confusing and scattered – and they were totally right. I developed a dark orange-tan-grey-black theme for this project. Since red and blue often indicate hot and cold, orange adds bold color but doesn’t step on color biases or expectations.<br>
•	<b>Iterate, iterate, iterate:</b> The resounding takeaway I have from this project is that iteration is key. Making and then remaking (and remaking again) charts, text blocks, and more was part and parcel of my design and layout process. It was important for me not to be “precious” about certain elements that I liked but that didn’t serve the story, or were confusing to viewers. On the road to the final story, I had to kill more than a few darlings.   

## Design decisions
•	<b>My 5 interviews reinforced the fact that I needed a better color palette.</b> One interviewee noted that she associates red with hot and blue with cold, so the usage of those colors throughout was nonintuitive. That’s a point well taken: I wanted to use those colors to show that energy insecurity is both a cold <em>and</em> hot weather phenomenon, but ultimately made things more confusing in so doing. So, I decided on a dark orange, tan, and black theme, for a more neutral palette.<br> 
•	<b>Another big design decision I made was to rehaul the regional energy insecurity map.</b> My interviewees and in-class peer review group noted confusion around the initial Tableau map: it appeared to be state-level data when it was actually regional, and the color gradation for the heat map was unclear. Here, I decided on a simpler fix: using a free/open source map of the US and modifying it in an image editor to create US regions. I outlined a few “comparison” regions in black and the southern regions that I wanted to highlight in dark orange and tan. I then used the “scrollpoints” feature in Shorthand to zoom into specific regions of the map, highlighting the fact that Southern states experience the highest energy insecurity rates. This isn’t quite as clean as the original Tableau map, but trading bells-and-whistles for simplicity here makes sense: by conveying less data, I elevate the story I want to tell. In that the audience is nontechnical, this simpler design choice is all the more effective.<br>
•	<b>I also ultimately decided to swap my tree map of energy insecurity coping strategies for a pictogram</b> highlighting that 1 in 5 US households skipped/reduce food or medicine to pay for utilities. Again, I am showing less data with this visualization, but I am showcasing what I think is the most salient data in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This ties into a general theme I found as I worked through edits to the final visualizations: simplicity and clarity are more important than “shiny” graphs. Understanding my audience, it’s not that reasonable to expect viewers to take more than a few seconds looking at a graph – certainly not a few minutes to decode it.<br> 
•	<b>I redid the intro sketch more than a few times.</b> This is a really important piece of my project: it personalizes energy insecurity, inviting the reader to pique their interest. But to get it right, I had to go through multiple iterations. At first, I borrowed a friend’s tablet and did a virtual version. This, however, didn’t look quite right: I didn’t get the nuance in shading that I wanted, and the formatting in Shorthand was off. I then transitioned to a watercolor version, which surprisingly took me less time and ended up looking cleaner, all things considered. I then uploaded the watercolor version into an image editor to do a series of finishing touches. While the perfectionist in me isn’t fully pleased with the final version, I realize that perfect is the enemy of good: I’m happy with how this element turned out.
