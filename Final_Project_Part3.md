## Part 3: Final Project 

### Refining scope & audience
After reviewing my interviews and reflecting on the project, I identified the audience as a group of nontechnical people who want a quick, digestible snapshot of energy insecurity. Specific audience members include congressional aides, who oversee a variety of policy issues and have limited bandwidth; policymakers at various levels (federal, state, and local), who want to know the essence of the issue and who it impacts; and advocates or curious members of the public, who want to better understand the issue and see what programs they can champion. As a baseline, I assume that the audience has no background in the issue, so I’ve tried to use simple language, free of jargon, to effectively communicate. I also realize that people might want to dive deeper into the issue, so I’ve shared links throughout from my sources, for individuals who want to further educate themselves. 

### High-level takeaways
•	<b>Simplicity is key:</b> I often found myself trading nice but less immediately legible charts for simpler ones. E.g., I swapped the tree map for a pictogram.
•	<b>Elevate lived experience:</b> From my original proposal onward, I have wanted to integrate the experiences of people who deal with energy insecurity on a daily basis. Throughout the story, I have added block quotes as stand-alone black-and white slides with yellow-text highlight to visually force viewers to contend with how energy insecurity actually impacts people.  
•	<b>Use color cohesively:</b> Many of my interviewees noted that the color scheme was confusing and scattered. I developed a dark orange-tan-grey-black theme for this project. Since red and blue often indicate hot and cold, orange adds bold color but doesn’t step on color biases or expectations.
