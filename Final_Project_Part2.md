### Structure:
<b>Establish Emotional Stakes:</b>
As in part 1, I am starting off with an emotional call, trying to make the broad concept of energy insecurity personal and felt. 

<em>To do:</em> I still need to do a “cleaned-up” version of the sketch of the woman experiencing energy insecurity. While I was initially going to do a watercolor version of the pencil sketch, a friend graciously offered to let me borrow his tablet, so that should make the final version even cleaner. 
<br>
<br>
<b>The “who” of energy insecurity:</b>
Then, I lead into the “who” of energy insecurity. Since energy insecurity is racialized – families of color experience it at higher rates – I’ve created a chart that highlights this. 

<em>To do:</em> I will add text with additional context around the demographics of energy insecurity, as well. 
<br>
<br>

<b>The “how” of energy insecurity:</b>
Next, I flow into a page on how households cope in the face of energy insecurity. Nationwide, 24.61 households will either reduce or skip meals or medicine to pay for energy bills, while 12.2 million leave their homes at unhealthy temperatures. 

<em>To do:</em> I will pull out quotes from source material to highlight the lived experiences of people experiencing energy insecurity. 
<br>
<br>
<b>The “where” of energy insecurity:</b>
This is where I start bringing in the theme of climate change. Here, I have the map

    <td>Digestible amount of information; wasn't overwhelmed.</td>
    <td>Liked that the initial framing was simply and relatable. Variety of charts ws engaging. Liked the section headers and use of bold font. </td>
    <td>The headings were helpful guides.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What didn't you like?</th>
    <td>Color scheme is not consistent.</td>
    <td>The "What can we do?" section felt vague. Give more info on why the programs identified would address energy insecurity, perahps with a worked example.</td>
    <td>The color palette wasn't cohesive.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>What was confusing? Did you want more info on anything?</th>
    <td>The tree map wasn't easily interpretable on first glance</td>
    <td>Didn't understand how building inspections could address the problem.</td>
    <td>The Tableau map wasn't clear — what did the colors represent?</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Any suggestions?</th>
    <td>Create unified color scheme. Add labels to tree map.</td>
    <td>More detail in the "What can we do?" section. Contextaulize the calls to action.</td>
    <td>Work with colors to communicate message more effectively.</td>
