# Telling-Stories-with-Data

## About me:  
My name is Sara Maillacheruvu (she/her/hers), and I am a second year Master of Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. Leveraging my strong analytical and writing skills, I am excited to communicate complex data via clear and legible visualizations to improve policymaking processes and engage communities in policy planning and evaluation. 

I began my career working on community development issues as an urban planner and housing / grants specialist at the City of Peoria, IL. I also focused on food access issues at the City, securing $40,000 in funding to run research-in-praxis farmers markets with Peoria's Southside neighborhood. I then transitioned to a role as an [Emerson Fellow](https://www.hungercenter.org/people/sara-maillacheruvu/), where I worked on federal food policy issues at the Native American Agriculture Fund and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, with a specific focus on land, agriculture, and commmodity distribution programs for Native American communities. This past summer, I interned with the Government Accountability Office on a transportation efficiency project and am currently collaborating with a CMU research group on building an assetmapping tool for Southwestern Pennsylvania communities to use in their economic development efforts. 

## What I hope to learn: 
I am excited to gain an understanding of the theory behind data visualization, as well as how to operationalize that theory in practice. I also look forward to creating a portfolio of work that I can iteratively improve over the course of the class, with the feedback of my classmates. I hope to leverage these skills in a career focused on policy research and evaluation, using data visualizations as a way to bridge knowledge divides and inform policymakers in their decisionmaking.
