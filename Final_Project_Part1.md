## Outline
### Project Summary: 
In 2020, over 1 in 4 U.S. households experienced energy insecurity, a condition defined as “the inability to meet basic household energy needs” [(Hern&aacute;ndez, 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114037/). Energy insecurity negatively impacts families’ health, and unsafe indoor temperatures are especially dangerous for elderly people and children [(McGeehin and Mirabelli, 2001)](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.109-1240665). There are also racial and ethnic dimensions to energy insecurity: studies have shown that Black and Hispanic households experience energy insecurity at higher rates [(Memmott, et al, 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-00763-9). In the face of climate change and increasing severe weather events, we need a strong energy policy system to protect vulnerable families from the negative health and social impacts associated with energy insecurity.

### Project Structure: 
#### Set-Up: Establish the emotional stakes of energy insecurity 
I realize that, as a concept, energy security may be ambiguous, vague, and unfelt for most of my readers. So, in the set-up of the project, in addition to sharing the textbook definition of energy insecurity, I want to <b>establish the emotional stakes of energy insecurity</b> with either a story, quote, or image, framed with a nudge that makes the reader think about energy insecurity in their own life: have <em>they</em> ever turned off the heater or AC to save money, making their home too hot or too cold in the process? 

#### Conflict: The who, what, and where of energy insecurity 
Next, I want to show the reader the <b>who, what, and where of energy insecurity</b>: who experiences energy insecurity at the greatest rates, what causes energy insecurity, and where energy insecurity is concentrated. I will accomplish this through a series of charts, graphics, and maps, in addition to text description of the issues. I plan to include visualizations such a map demonstrating where energy insecurity rates are highest across the country, as well as a chart (maybe a tree graph) showing how households cope in the face of energy insecurity. I hope that the chart on coping mechanisms will further elicit pathos from the reader and embody the issue further: thinking about someone skipping a meal so that they can keep the heat on makes the issue all the more tangible. In addition, I want to sow the seed that climate change will only exacerbate energy insecurity and for the most vulnerable populations, as this is a part of my call-to-action. 

<b>I also want to supplement the data with stories and quotes from individuals who have experienced energy insecurity themselves</b>. This is, after all, a data <em>story</em>, and the lived experiences of people who experience the issues is critical in crafting informed policy solutions. There is a wonderful researcher named [Diana Hern&aacute;ndez]( https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/faculty-action/energy-insecurity) whose perspective, [work]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114037/), and [interviews]( https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1413) I would love to draw from in supplementing the visualizations. 

#### Resolution: Policy interventions 
At this stage, the reader will ideally have both an emotional connection to the topic, as well as a firmer grasp on what energy insecurity constitutes and who it impacts. With this established, I want to end with forward-thinking policy interventions, <b>reinforcing that energy insecurity is only likely to get worse in the future with climate change</b> – that is, establishing the <em>urgency</em> of the action. Some suggested solutions might include expansion of existing programs, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program, as well as novel energy efficiency programs that are climate-resilient, targeted to low-income populations.  

## Sketches: 

## Data:
<b>I will source the bulk of my data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in particular from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).</b> You can access the [landing page of the data here]( https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/) and download the CSVs for years and topics of interest. While the EIA provides [data dating back to 1980](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/previous.php), I anticipate that I will focus on more recent years, likely from 2000 onward. Importantly, the EIA did not begin explicitly tracking energy insecurity in RECS until 2015. Therefore, my ability to make temporal comparisons on energy insecurity is limited. However, I can comment on changes in types of fuels and levels of consumption over time, pieces of information which are tracked across survey years. 

<b>The EIA provides state-level and US region level data, so I anticipate that I will make maps to highlight geographic trends in the data.</b> Since energy insecurity is tied to household’s income as well as the quality of a home (older or more poorly insulated homes are likely to require more energy), I am particularly excited by a [table from the 2020 RECS on structural characteristics of homes for different states]( https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eia.gov%2Fconsumption%2Fresidential%2Fdata%2F2020%2Fstate%2Fxls%2FState%2520Structural%2520Characteristics.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK), which includes data on when homes were built, the types of windows used (important for insulation), and power outages. A chart – perhaps a simple bar chart, or perhaps a bubble chart – would provide a visual entryway to the fact that these features are important predictors of energy insecurity.

In addition, I am interested in using the [2020 Household Energy Insecurity data]( https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eia.gov%2Fconsumption%2Fresidential%2Fdata%2F2020%2Fhc%2Fxls%2FHC%252011.1.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) to make a variety of charts. In particular, I want to <b>break down the coping mechanisms that households engage in in the face of energy insecurity</b>. I think I could make engaging unit charts here: e.g., in a given region, such as the Northeast, of people experiencing energy insecurity, how many reduced their food costs to keep utilities on? I also could make regional energy insecurity map to highlight areas of the US that experience energy insecurity at higher rates. This has important policy implications in terms of identifying where the problem is greatest, as well as what solutions will be most effective (i.e., in the Southwest, a policy intervention focused on heating services is not likely to make a meaningful difference in energy insecurity, whereas one focused on cooling services would). 



## Method and Medium: 
<b>I will use Flourish, Tableau, and other packages (as needed) to create charts and graphics for the final project</b>. In addition to the visualizations, I will write a text narrative to guide readers through the project, providing content to enrich the visuals. For more complex charts, I will offer summaries and provide the required information for casual readers to quickly understand them. However, I will aim for simplicity in creating visualizations to make the project as accessible possible. Further, I am to avoid jargon and technical terms that would confuse casual readers – if I find myself needing to use technical language, I will explain terms upon first use. 

<b>To combine my charts, graphics, and text write-ups, I will use Shorthand</b>. I expect there may be some iteration in embedding Tableau and Flourish graphics to Shorthand – perhaps a chart’s aspect ratio will change upon upload – so I will budget time to work through potential hiccups. Shorthand’s capabilities are many – scrolling, zooming in, etc. – and I will explore these features to find a presentation flow that balances user engagement with navigability
