## Method and Medium: 
<b>I will use Flourish, Tableau, and other packages (as needed) to create charts and graphics for the final project<b>. In addition to the visualizations, I will write a text narrative to guide readers through the project, providing content to enrich the visuals. For more complex charts, I will offer summaries and provide the required information for casual readers to quickly understand them. However, I will aim for simplicity in creating visualizations to make the project as accessible possible. Further, I am to avoid jargon and technical terms that would confuse casual readers – if I find myself needing to use technical language, I will explain terms upon first use. 

<b>To combine my charts, graphics, and text write-ups, I will use Shorthand<b>. I expect there may be some iteration in embedding Tableau and Flourish graphics to Shorthand – perhaps a chart’s aspect ratio will change upon upload – so I will budget time to work through potential hiccups. Shorthand’s capabilities are many – scrolling, zooming in, etc. – and I will explore these features to find a presentation flow that balances user engagement with navigability
