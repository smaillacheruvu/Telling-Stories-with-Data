## Summary
In 2020, over 1 in 4 U.S. households experienced energy insecurity, a term that is defined as “the inability to meet basic household energy needs” (Hernandez, [“Understanding ‘energy insecurity’ and why it matters to health"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114037/). Energy insecurity negatively impacts families’ health, and unsafe indoor temperatures are especially dangerous for elderly people and children (McGeehin and Mirabelli, [“The Potential Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Temperature-Related Morbidity and Mortality in the United States”](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.109-1240665). There are also racial and ethnic dimensions to energy insecurity: studies have shown that Black and Hispanic households experience energy insecurity at higher rates (Memmott, et al, [“Sociodemographic disparities in energy insecurity among low-income households before and during the COVID-19 pandemic”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-00763-9). In the face of climate change and increasing severe weather events, we need a strong energy policy system to protect vulnerable families from the negative health and social impacts associated with energy insecurity. 


## Method and Medium: 
<b>I will use Flourish, Tableau, and other packages (as needed) to create charts and graphics for the final project</b>. In addition to the visualizations, I will write a text narrative to guide readers through the project, providing content to enrich the visuals. For more complex charts, I will offer summaries and provide the required information for casual readers to quickly understand them. However, I will aim for simplicity in creating visualizations to make the project as accessible possible. Further, I am to avoid jargon and technical terms that would confuse casual readers – if I find myself needing to use technical language, I will explain terms upon first use. 

<b>To combine my charts, graphics, and text write-ups, I will use Shorthand</b>. I expect there may be some iteration in embedding Tableau and Flourish graphics to Shorthand – perhaps a chart’s aspect ratio will change upon upload – so I will budget time to work through potential hiccups. Shorthand’s capabilities are many – scrolling, zooming in, etc. – and I will explore these features to find a presentation flow that balances user engagement with navigability
