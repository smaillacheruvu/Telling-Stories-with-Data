### Discussion: 

The three visualizations above represent the same data but are conveyed in different ways. The OECD 

The third visualization is a line chart that focuses on European countries' debt-to-GDP ratios from 1995 to 2019. I wanted to create a graph that contextualized the data geographically, but there were far too many countries to derive a trend at the national level. I also noted that most of the countries in the data set are European, which meant that broad continental regional analysis was largely drowned out by the web of European countries. I decided to code the data into European regions to highlight an interesting trend in the data: southern European countries, in general, have the highest ratios across this timeframe. Leveraging a colorblind-friendly palette, I chose a bold warm-toned hue (magenta) for southern European countries to visually reinforce the fact that their ratios were the highest (and that high ratios are not desirable). I colored western Europe grey because that region's data had a wide range of ratios, which, if imbued with a non-grey hue, fought against southern Europe's magenta and distracted from the message I wanted to highlight from the data.
